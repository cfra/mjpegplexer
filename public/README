This Interface is developed to work with firefox 27.0.1.

Installation
============

1.	Download mjpegplexer: 
	http://git.sublab.org/mjpegplexer/

2. 	Setup mjpegplexer properly.

3. 	Copy the contents of cctv-control to the root 
	of your webserver and set the camera-host-IP 
	to the server that runs mjpegplexer. 

Omit Printing-Dialogue
======================

To make firefox not display the printing dialogue a config
option needs to be added. I recommend to print to a file, 
for everything to work as expected.

1. 	enter "about:config" and hit enter

2. 	create a new boolean (right-click) 
	with the name "print.always_silent_print" 
	and set it to "true"

3.	set "print.print_to_file" to "true"

4. 	set your preferred filename in 
	"print.print_to_filename"

5.(opt) adapt values of footers and headers for your needs


Default Values
==============

print.always_silent_print	false
print.print_to_file		false

print.footerleft        &PT	//Pagenumber
print.footerright       &D	//Date
print.headerleft        &T	//?
print.headerright       &U	//Filename
